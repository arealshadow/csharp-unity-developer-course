  storyText: 'Slowly you manage to get closer, the snowstorm starts to clear and you
    can finally see a little bit better that there really is a house, a real house
    in front of your eyes. It looks abandoned, there''s probably nobody inside and
    there could be a chance for you to find some resources, but, what do I know, you''re
    the expert.

    What will you do?


    A. Quietly check the house from the outside to make sure nobody''s in.

    B. Force your way in.'
