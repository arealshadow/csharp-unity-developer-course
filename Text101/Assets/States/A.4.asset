  storyText: 'A loud horn can be heard from the distance, this means that the bubble
    of death is starting to shrink, you find yourself in the red zone, this means
    that the bubble of death can kill you if it catches up with you. Decide wisely.

    What will you do?


    A. Run with whatever stamina you have left.

    B. Wait for the bubble to kill you because you realize that you can''t escape
