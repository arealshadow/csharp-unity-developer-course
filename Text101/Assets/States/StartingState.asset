  storyText: 'Moscow, 2031. The world is dying. Storm troopers are taking control
    of every sector. You are Mikhail Vladivostok, a professional meme engineer, one
    of the last human survivors of the storm fighting to remain alive in the bubble
    of death.

    You wake up in the snow, cold and dizzy. Through the snowstorm, you notice something
    that resembles a house. What will you do?


    A. Get closer to check if it really could be a house.

    B. Go the opposite of the house.'
